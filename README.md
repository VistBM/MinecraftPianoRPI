# MinecraftPianoRPI
A Minecraft python project used for Raspberry Pi systems.

This project is called the SonicPi Minecraft Piano. 
This project takes minecraft player inputs and uses the inputs to output certain notes using 
SonicPi (audio production programming language).

To run the project all you need to do is open the SonicPi File, and the PythonFileMC in the Minecraft Piano FSCJ. 
Click run on the Python IDE and step over the player made piano. 
You should hear a different sound for each block you step over like a piano.
